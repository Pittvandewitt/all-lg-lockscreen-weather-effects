# All weather effects

This module adds the line "ro.product.brand_dsny=true" (short for Disney, yes) to your build.prop file. Instead of modifying the lockscreen apk and replacing the original one, this is the proper way to achieve the desired result.
Don't forget to enable the feature in settings - lockscreen and security - Change lockscreen - show weather

# Supported ROMs
This edit only works on stock LG roms with LGKeyguardEffects.apk preinstalled.
Confirmed working on LG G7 and LG V30
Expected to work on many more fairly recent LG devices
